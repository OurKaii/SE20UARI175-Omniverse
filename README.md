Model - Air-Conditioner.

I created a 3D model of a air conditioner in Blender. The model is based on a real-world air conditioner, and its dimensions are mentioned in the dataset excel file in x,y and z direction . The model has a realistic design, with a white metal body, a black plastic grille, along with fan in build.

Materials
I used a variety of materials to create the air conditioner model. The metal body of the air conditioner is made of a glossy white material. The plastic grille is made of a matte black material which is then coloured yellow.

Environment
I placed the air conditioner model in a living room environment. with a light source and along with i have add pipes to form a connection betweeen the pipes - air conditioner(fans) and - light source.

Lighting
I used natural light to illuminate the living room environment.along with made a light source to make to look more realistic.

Composition
I positioned the air conditioner model in the bottom on the floor with bird eye view camera with everything connected between them smootly.

Rendering
Most of it's been used by the inbuild source of blender made the work nice and easy
